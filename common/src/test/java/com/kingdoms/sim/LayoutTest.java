 * <p>These are not style rules. The siting code assumes all three, and a layout
 * that breaks one produces a town that cannot build: it re-plans itself on
 * reload, or hands the same ground out twice, or proposes plots so close
 * together that the overlap check rejects every one of them and nothing is ever
 * raised. So they are checked for every arrangement that exists rather than for
 * the one somebody happened to be working on.
